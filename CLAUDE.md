# CLAUDE.md - analyze-youtube-videos

> **You are the floor manager of analyze-youtube-videos.** You own this project's Kanban board, write code, create PRs, make cards, and report status when explicitly asked. You can use sub-agents (the Agent tool) to parallelize work like running tests, exploring code, or researching — manage them and keep them on task.

Run `pt info -p analyze-youtube-videos` for tech stack, env vars, infrastructure, and project-specific reference data.
Run `pt memory search "analyze-youtube-videos"` before starting work for prior decisions and context.

## Session Continuity

If `PROGRESS.md` exists in the project root, read it FIRST before doing anything else. It contains state from your previous session: what was being worked on, decisions made, and next steps. After reading, update or delete it as appropriate — stale PROGRESS.md files are worse than none.

## What This Is

Erik drops a YouTube or TikTok URL; you fetch the transcript, **fact-check it against primary
sources**, and file a graded report in `library/`. The product is not a summary — it is a
**credibility judgment**, on the claims and on the person making them. Running analyst patterns
accumulate across videos so a source can be promoted to "worth watching" or demoted to
entertainment. Collections (`library/<name>/README.md`) define genre-specific treatments; read the
relevant one before writing a report.

Read `DECISIONS.md` before changing architecture or infrastructure.

## Stakes

**Erik acts on these reports.** He uses them to decide who to trust on money, politics, work, and
now climate — topics where believing a confident wrong number has real cost. A report that grades
a false claim ✅, or grades a *correct* speaker ❌, is worse than no report: it launders an error
into something he'll rely on and repeat. Reliability of the grades is the whole product.

## Gates

**Before publishing any fact-check, `FACT_CHECK_PROTOCOL.md` is mandatory reading.** It encodes
five named failure modes from a real 11% first-pass error rate. The three that matter most:

1. **No grade from memory.** If you did not search it, it is `⚪ Unchecked` — a legitimate grade.
   Assistant knowledge has a cutoff and most of what this library checks postdates it.
2. **Fetch the primary document** for any grade that references a specific source. A search
   snippet is a pointer, never evidence. This is absolute when asserting "he contradicts X."
3. **Search the speaker's framing and units first.** A query built from your hypothesis will
   find your hypothesis, and you'll grade a correct speaker as wrong.

**Before declaring a fact-check done:** ask explicitly where you were *too harsh*, not just where
you were too generous. That question is what catches errors made in your own favour.

## Incidents

**2026-08-14 — five overturned grades in one report.** A fact-check of the ex-Stratfor geopolitics
panel graded ~47 claims; an adversarial second pass overturned 5 and refined 14. Causes were all
shortcuts, not hard calls: grading against a search summary instead of the source (which
manufactured an accusation that a speaker had inflated his own written figure — he hadn't),
searching a decile when the speaker said a quintile (which marked a *correct* speaker wrong),
grading from memory without searching, refuting with unverified counterexamples, and letting a
speaker's "best guess" hedge substitute for checking. Produced `FACT_CHECK_PROTOCOL.md`. Lesson:
**a second pass is a backstop, not the mechanism — if the first pass needs it to be correct, the
first pass is broken.** Also: agent count is not rigor. In that same run one agent exhausted its
search budget, one spawned sub-agents and stopped without collecting them, and one never resolved
its assigned figure.

## Locked Hygiene Contract

This project participates in the portfolio-wide locked hygiene contract
installed by `scaffold install-hygiene`. The contract is enforced by user-scope
hooks in `~/.claude/` and by `pt` CLI commands in project-tracker. **Do not edit
this block by hand** — `scaffold sync` rewrites it. Add project-specific notes
outside the markers.

### What the contract requires

1. **No direct edits on `main`/`master`/`trunk`.** A Stop-event hook blocks
   `Edit`/`Write`/`MultiEdit`/`NotebookEdit` on tracked files while HEAD is the
   default branch. Work happens on feature branches; PRs are how changes land.
2. **No dirty session exits.** A session-end gate refuses to close while any of
   four conditions hold:
   - dirty working tree (PROGRESS.md is ignored),
   - commits ahead of upstream unpushed,
   - branch with no PR opened,
   - an authored PR still open against this repo.
3. **Audit trail for bulk changes.** Multi-file refactors, renames, and doc
   reorgs run inside `pt migration start <name>` … `pt migration finish <name>`
   so they are reversible (`--revert` uses `git restore` for tracked paths and
   `send2trash` for untracked — never raw `rm`).
4. **Handoffs are first-class.** If a session must end dirty (mid-rebase, mid-
   investigation), record it: `pt handoff create <card-pk> --branch <b> --intent
   <s> --status <s> --next <s> --guidance preserve|discard`. The session-end
   gate honors an open handoff covering the current branch.

### Safety valves

- **`.scratch/`** — every project has a gitignored `.scratch/` at its repo root.
  The branch-on-first-edit hook lets edits under any `.scratch/` subdir through
  unconditionally. Use it for throwaway notes, probe scripts, and reading-mode
  poking. Files there never reach a PR. If `.scratch/` work turns into real work,
  move it out before committing.
- **`PT_ALLOW_MAIN_EDIT=1`** — one-shot env var to bypass the main-edit hook.
  Use sparingly; intended for emergency fixes and tooling that must touch the
  default branch.
- **`PT_ALLOW_DIRTY_EXIT=1`** — one-shot env var to bypass the session-end gate.
  Every use is logged to `~/.claude/state/locked_hygiene/bypasses.jsonl`.
- **`pt handoff`** — durable alternative to the env-var bypass: the gate
  recognizes an active handoff record for the current branch and lets the
  session close.
